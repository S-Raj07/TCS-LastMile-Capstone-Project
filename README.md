🌍 Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
📌 Project: GreenForce – Carbon Footprint & Sustainability Management Platform on Salesforce
1. Introduction

Sustainability has become a global priority. Businesses are under pressure from regulators, investors, and customers to reduce their environmental footprint and adopt transparent ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) reporting.

Investors prefer sustainable businesses.

Growing demand for digital solutions in carbon tracking.
